# # Automated AWS Client VPN Session Management
This solution automates the management of AWS Client VPN sessions by terminating sessions that exceed a predefined duration. Using AWS Lambda and EventBridge, it ensures that user sessions are automatically monitored and closed after a set time, enhancing security and resource efficiency. Users benefit from reduced manual oversight, improved session management, and compliance with security policies, all with minimal setup and maintenance.
## Use Case
In environments where security and resource optimization are critical, managing VPN session durations is essential. This solution is ideal for organizations that need to enforce session timeouts for compliance or to prevent long-standing idle connections. For example, in a corporate setting where sensitive data is accessed via AWS Client VPN, automatically terminating sessions after a specified time helps mitigate risks of unauthorized access, reduces the attack surface, and ensures that resources are not unnecessarily consumed by inactive connections. This is particularly useful for IT administrators aiming to enhance security while minimizing manual intervention.
